Building and training a neural network to classify images of clothing, including items like sneakers and shirts, using TensorFlow and the Fashion MNIST dataset.
We developed and configured the neural network model, preprocessed the data, and trained the model to achieve high accuracy in classifying clothing items. 
The project utilized various TensorFlow components, including tf.keras, to create, compile, and train the model.
Technologies: TensorFlow, TensorFlow Datasets, NumPy, matplotlib, Python
